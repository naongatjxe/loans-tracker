# Loan Tracker

Loan Tracker is a Flutter app designed to help you manage and track money you loan to others. It makes it easy to record borrowers, calculate interest, track repayments, and generate loan contracts.

## Features

- **Loan Management:** Add, view, and update loans for each person you lend money to.
- **Interest Calculation:** Calculates weekly interest and total amount due for each loan.
- **Repayment Tracking:** Mark loans as paid/unpaid and see payment summaries.
- **PDF Contract Generation:** Create and export loan contracts as PDF files with borrower details (name, NRC, phone, workplace/school, company).
- **CSV Export:** Export all loan data to a CSV file for backup or sharing.
- **Dark Theme:** Modern, easy-on-the-eyes dark mode.
- **About & Settings:** View app info (Loan Tracker Pro, developer Naonga Gondwe, version beta 1, company CommandLine) and switch themes.
- **Android 6+ Support:** Runs on Android devices with API 21 and above.

## How It Works

1. **Add a Loan:** Enter borrower details, loan amount, interest rate, and due date.
2. **Track Payments:** See principal, interest, and total due. Mark loans as paid when settled.
3. **Export Data:** Use the top-right export button to save all loans as a CSV file. Share or back up as needed.
4. **Generate Contracts:** Fill in borrower info and print a PDF contract for signatures.
